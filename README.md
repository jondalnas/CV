## Hobby Projects
Over the years, I have done a lot of hobby projects, here are some of the better.

* [Java Christmas Calendar Candle](https://github.com/jondalnas/ChristmasCalendarCandle): A Christmas calendar candle simulated on the CPU. It takes a PNG as input and simulates each pixel on it as a clump of wax.
* [C++ Christmas Calendar Candle](https://github.com/jondalnas/CppChristmasCalendarCandle): A revamped Christmas calendar candle, made in C++. This time the candle uses a 3D grid, which should help with some of the anomalies.
* [Word Cross Square](https://github.com/jondalnas/Word-Cross-Square): My grandmother likes to write 3 letter words on cards for me and my family, where the middle letter matches, this is the same idea but for all lengths of words.

### Computer Graphics
3D Graphics has always been a fascination of mine, I usually create a path tracer as my first project in a new language - Expect this list to grow.

* [Simple Java Game Engine](https://github.com/jondalnas/SJGE): As the title implies; a simple game engine made with Java. The engine uses a self-written tile based renderer to draw the graphics, which supports translation, rotation, and scaling, all manipulating the pixels on the screen directly.
* [C3D Tracing - A C Based Path-Tracer](https://github.com/jondalnas/C3D-Tracing): A path-tracer made in C. This was to get familiar with the C programming language.
* [OpenGL Game Engine](https://github.com/jondalnas/OpenGL): A OpenGL game engine written in Java. It uses LWJGL as the base, to interface with the input method and render to the screen.
* [Java 3D Path Tracer](https://github.com/jondalnas/3D-Ray-Tracer): The first path-tracer I made, in Java. The project is the base for my understanding of path-tracers and how they work.

## School Projects
Here are the projects I have created either alone or in groups at high school and university.

* [Hardware Accelerated Neural Network](https://github.com/jondalnas/Hardware-Accelerated-Neural-Network): An AI accelerator written in VHDL. The accelerator is based on the ONNX standard, and implements some of the basic operators. It works by generating a main VHDL file, which connects all the different components together, based on a target model.
* [Audio Synthesis Chip](https://github.com/jondalnas/31015-Audio-Synthesis): An ISA for a sound synthesis chip. This chip works much like a traditional MCU, but supports many instructions specific for audio synthesis.
* [RISC-V Simulator](https://github.com/jondalnas/02155-Final-Assignment): A RISC-V simulator written in C++.
* [Asteroid Orbitor Game on STM32](https://github.com/jondalnas/30010-Programmerings-Projekt): An asteroid orbiting game, where you need to take out the opponent. Each player plans out a trajectory and if they want to shoot or not, and then let the physics engine pull them around. The game is written to work in an STM32, so many optimizations were needed - I do not want to talk about the gravity calculations.
* [Shooting Range Controller](https://github.com/jondalnas/ShootingRange): A controller for a shooting range target mover. This controller makes sure that the target is moved correctly and that the user does not get their fingers cut off, if they place them into the machine.
* [GameGirl - Breadboard Gaming Console](https://github.com/jondalnas/Gamegirl): A breadboard gaming console, which uses an Arduino emulating a MOS6502.
* [Auto De-Tuner](https://github.com/jondalnas/Auto-De-Tuner): An autotuner, but it messes up the octals, so everything sounds worse. We found out that the Arduino it runs on only supports 1 sound channel and is not capable of doing almost any Fourier transforms. The idea was to listen on a microphone, Fourier transform the input, mess it up with a functions, and then play it back.
* [Java Path-Tracer](https://github.com/jondalnas/Exam): The exam project for our high school programming class. The project was a path-tracer written in Java, much like the graphic projects shown before.
* [Java Platformer](https://github.com/jondalnas/Miniproject): The final project before the exam. A platformer written in Java, with vector based levels, which uses an in-house physics engine for collision. The game is a sequel to a previous game called "[Ultimate Jump Box](https://gitlab.com/mat-prog/ultimate-jump-box)".
* [Room Scanning Robot](https://github.com/jondalnas/ScanningRobot): A robot, which scans a room, position by position. The idea was for a simple robot using treads to move around and scan the depth of the room. If there was a place it did not have information on, it would move to that location to do another scan.
* [Automatic Line Following Robot - With PID controller](https://github.com/jondalnas/SO7): A small robot, which can follow a line. The controller of the robot includes a PID controller, which allows for more precession. In the end, the shell of the robot killed it. It also has a remote controller to it, allowing for a balloon fight at the end of the project, and most importantly, we have a button to make it spin!
* [Shadow Harry Ninja](https://github.com/jondalnas/Shadow-Harry-Ninja): A game about accepting your body hair. The game is a "Street Fighter" clone, where you can choose from a roster of 4 character, all attacking in different ways, with their body hair.


## Games
Games have always been a passion of mine - I like playing them, collecting them, and occasionally creating them.

* [Cetris - C Tetris](https://github.com/jondalnas/Cetris): A C terminal based implementation of Tetris.
* [Fsnake - F\# Snake](https://github.com/jondalnas/FSnake): A Snake clone made in F\#.
* [Reaper GBA Demake](https://github.com/jondalnas/Reaper-GBA-Demake): Made for a game jam, with the theme of creating a GBA game. I wanted to test my abilities, so I ended up porting the Dudum Dare game "Reaper" to the GBA.


### Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is a biannual game creation competition, of which I have participated 11 times.

* [Ludum Dare 38 - Live or DIE!](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare38): The theme was "A Small World". The game is a survival colony builder, with a randomly generated world, where different jobs can be added to a queue, which your colonists will complete in order.
* [Ludum Dare 39 - Death's Helper](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare39): The theme was "Running out of Power". The game is a 2D side-scroller, hack n' slash. You have a blade and a gun, which you can use to mow down the enemies, or a teleport to move around quickly.
* [Ludum Dare 40 - Area 51](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare40): The theme was "The more you have, the worse it is". The game is a top-down, "Hotline Miami"-like shooter. You have a gun, which regenerates ammo as time passes, however the bullets slow you down. All walls are covered in a special ricocheting material, which bounces your bullets around when hit.
* [Ludum Dare 41 - Soccer for Strategy](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare41): The theme was "Combine two incompatible genres". The game is a top-down, turn-based strategy football game. You select characters and where they should move, shoot the ball and try to get as many goals as possible. The enemy team is controlled with an AI.
* [Ludum Dare 42 - Galactic Wars](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare42): The theme was "Running out of space". The game is an Asteroids clone, with a shrinking border. The game focuses heavily on the aesthetic of the game, using vector like graphics.
* [Ludum Dare 44 - Galaxy Explorer](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare44): The theme was "Your life is currency". The game is a gravity based galaxy exploration games, with different asteroids you can explore. To get fuel to your ship, you have to mine out the asteroids you find, by dropping infrastructure.
* [Ludum Dare 45 - Unfinished: The Game](https://github.com/jondalnas/Ludum-Dare-45): The theme was "Start with nothing". The game is a 2D side-scrolling crawling game. The original idea was for it to be a "Shadow of the Colossus" clone.
* [Ludum Dare 46 - The Apocalypse](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare46): The theme was "Keep it alive". The game is a 2D side-scrolling parkour platformer, where you need to get to the end of the level before a timer runs out.
* [Ludum Dare 47 - Dank Dungeon](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare47): The theme was "Stuck in a loop". The game is a top down, "Legend of Zelda"-like dungeon crawler. There are different enemies which you will need to deal with in different ways. The game's engine was completely written from scratch in Java.
* [Ludum Dare 48 - Reaper](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare48): The theme was "Deeper and Deeper". The game is a top down, "Hotline Miami"-like shooter, without a gun. You play as a reaper, which can hit with his scythe, throw it, teleport to an enemy, and mind control an enemy. The goal is to kill all enemies on a floor, to advance to a final boos.
* [Ludum Dare 53 - X-treme Deliveries](https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare53): The theme was "Delivery". The game is a compilation of mini-games with a GameBoy aesthetic. Every level is fast paced, only lasting for a couple of seconds.

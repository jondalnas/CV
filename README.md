## Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is a biannual game creation competition, of which I have participated 11 times.

* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare38](Ludum Dare 38 - Live or DIE!): The theme was "A Small World". The game is a survival colony builder, with a randomly generated world, where different jobs can be added to a queue, which your colonists will complete in order.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare39](Ludum Dare 39 - Death's Helper): The theme was "Running out of Power". The game is a 2D side-scroller, hack n' slash. You have a blade and a gun, which you can use to mow down the enemies, or a teleport to move around quickly.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare40](Ludum Dare 40 - Area 51): The theme was "The more you have, the worse it is". The game is a top-down, "Hotline Miami"-like shooter. You have a gun, which regenerates ammo as time passes, however the bullets slow you down. All walls are covered in a special ricocheting material, which bounces your bullets around when hit.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare41](Ludum Dare 41 - Soccer for Strategy): The theme was "Combine two incompatible genres". The game is a top-down, turn-based strategy football game. You select characters and where they should move, shoot the ball and try to get as many goals as possible. The enemy team is controlled with an AI.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare42](Ludum Dare 42 - Galactic Wars): The theme was "Running out of space". The game is an Asteroids clone, with a shrinking border. The game focuses heavily on the aesthetic of the game, using vector like graphics.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare44](Ludum Dare 44 - Galaxy Explorer): The theme was "Your life is currency". The game is a gravity based galaxy exploration games, with different asteroids you can explore. To get fuel to your ship, you have to mine out the asteroids you find, by dropping infrastructure.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/Ludum-Dare-45](Ludum Dare 45 - Unfinished: The Game): The theme was "Start with nothing". The game is a 2D side-scrolling crawling game. The original idea was for it to be a "Shadow of the Colossus" clone.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare46](Ludum Dare 46 - The Apocalypse): The theme was "Keep it alive". The game is a 2D side-scrolling parkour platformer, where you need to get to the end of the level before a timer runs out.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare47](Ludum Dare 47 - Dank Dungeon): The theme was "Stuck in a loop". The game is a top down, "Legend of Zelda"-like dungeon crawler. There are different enemies which you will need to deal with in different ways. The game's engine was completely written from scratch in Java.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare48](Ludum Dare 48 - Reaper): The theme was "Deeper and Deeper". The game is a top down, "Hotline Miami"-like shooter, without a gun. You play as a reaper, which can hit with his scythe, throw it, teleport to an enemy, and mind control an enemy. The goal is to kill all enemies on a floor, to advance to a final boos.
* [https://github.com/jondalnas/LudumDare53](Ludum Dare 53 - X-treme Deliveries): The theme was "Delivery". The game is a compilation of mini-games with a GameBoy aesthetic. Every level is fast paced, only lasting for a couple of seconds.
